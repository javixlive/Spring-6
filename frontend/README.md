Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Must create an `environment.ts` file with your own `Token Key Url` in order to work.

## How it was done

Since it was my first time working with angular I didn't know the best practices for creating a new project, hence the testing part of the app was a mess at the end when i got to that part and i will work on migrating the project to a more suitable environment.

Asides from that must of the stuff implemented was from the Liderly crash course on Angular, big help!

## Known Issues

Some stuff has issues with the new API 

## Retrospective

| What was done well? | What can I do differently? | What didn't go well? |
------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------
| Most things went really well for a first timer! | Create the project on a more efficient way that doesn't cause issues later on. | TESTS! and styles could be so much better with a bit more time.
